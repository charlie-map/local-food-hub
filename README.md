# local-food-hub
A website for keeping track of different forms that are needed for local farmers. The goal of our website is to produce a way for farmers to see what exactly they need to fill out in order for their products to be considered safe for purchase.

# team
The team (Charlie, Isabella, Zach, Connor) have separated work out and have curated a website that had not existed before. Each member had many different tasks and managed to learn from and experience a huge number of problems. The initial goal and the current state are miles apart.

# issues
A current issue in question is the quota limit from the Google API. The goal is for Local Food Hub to make payments in order to have a comfortable amount for running each farm. On average, running the `/update` status function around 7 times in the timespan of 10 minutes can sustain fairly well on the free plan (working with a single farm). The question will be what happens when there's more than one farm.
